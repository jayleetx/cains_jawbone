# Cain's Jawbone
"The world's most fiendishly difficult literary puzzle"

## Background
[*Cain's Jawbone*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone) is a puzzle by Torquemada (a psuedonym of Edward Powys Mathers) published in 1934. The puzzle is a book whose 100 pages are presented out of order. Solving the puzzle entails correctly ordering the pages, identifying the names of the six murder victims in the story, and identifying each victim's killer. There have been two cash prizes offered in the past for correct solutions, though neither is currently open. Since the puzzle's publication, three people's solutions have been publicly confirmed as correct.

## Methodology
TBD lol, I'm still too early on to say how I'm approaching it.
